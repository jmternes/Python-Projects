# Python-Projects

### Here I will be adding Python Projects that I take on as I learn Python through The Tech Academy


## Projects:

### [Nice or Mean Game](https://github.com/jmternes/Python-Projects/blob/main/nice_or_mean.py)
### [File Transfer GUI](https://github.com/jmternes/Python-Projects/blob/main/filetransfer.py)
### [Banking App](https://github.com/jmternes/Django_Checkbook_Project)
### [Web Page Generator](https://github.com/jmternes/Python-Projects/blob/main/web_page_generator.py)



### Nice or Mean Game


#### This game uses vanilla Python to take user input and keep score based on their answers.


### File Transfer GUI
#### This project leverages the Python module Tkinter to create a GUI that allows the user to choose all .txt files from one directory, and move them to another of their choice.


#### This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database, and gives the user the capability to update and delete entries.


### Banking App
#### This project, built with Django, acts as a pseudo-banking app for a user. They can check their balance, deposit or withdraw funds, and their data is saved as an account under the name they give.


### Web Page Generator
#### This application takes input from a user, and displays it on a simple web page as a header.
