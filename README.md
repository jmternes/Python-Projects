# Python-Projects

### Here I will be adding Python Projects that I take on as I learn Python through The Tech Academy


## Projects:

### Nice or Mean Game
### Phonebook
### Banking App




### Nice or Mean Game


#### This game uses vanilla Python to take user input and keep score based on their answers.


### Phonebook


#### This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database, and gives the user the capability to update and delete entries.


### Banking App
#### This project, built with Django, acts as a pseudo-banking app for a user. They can check their balance, deposit or withdraw funds, and their data is saved as an account under the name they give.
